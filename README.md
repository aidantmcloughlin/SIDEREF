# SIDEREF
SIDEREF dissimilarity matrix for examining scRNA seq global relationships

Package development for key functions in this repository is in-progress. 

In order to reproduce all analysis, you may run:
  ``library(here)``
  
  ``source(here("R/main.R"))``
  
Package dependencies are located in ``R/libraries.R``.

You may contact **aidan_mcloughlin@berkeley.edu** for access to computationally 
intensive distance matrix objects.
